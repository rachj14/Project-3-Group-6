# Project Title: Exploring different factors impacting Mental Health

## Introduction:
Mental health is a pressing concern influenced by various environmental and lifestyle factors. This project aims to investigate the relationship between music consumption, social media usage, air pollution levels, and mental health outcomes using data available on Kaggle. Through efficient data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to uncover insights that may inform future research or interventions.

## Objectives:
- Analyse survey results on music consumption habits, social media usage patterns, air pollution exposure, and self-reported mental health indicators.
- Identify correlations between these factors to understand their potential impact on mental well-being.
- Create clear and concise visualizations using Python's Matplotlib library to present findings.
- Develop a preliminary interactive dashboard prototype using Flask and basic JavaScript functionality for data exploration.

## Methodology:
- Data Collection: Utilise provided datasets on music & mental health, social media & mental health, and air pollution & mental health surveys.
- Data Preprocessing: Quickly clean and preprocess the survey data using Python's Pandas library to handle missing values and merge datasets if necessary.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct brief EDA to identify initial trends and correlations in the datasets. Use Matplotlib to create simple visualizations such as bar plots, scatter plots, or pie charts.
- Statistical Analysis: Perform basic statistical analysis to assess correlations between music, social media, air pollution, and mental health variables.
- Dashboard Development: Develop a basic web-based dashboard prototype using Flask for the backend and minimal JavaScript for simple interactivity.

## Expected Deliverables:
- Preliminary analysis report summarizing key findings and insights.
- Simple visualizations showcasing correlations between factors.
- Basic interactive dashboard prototype allowing for limited data exploration.

## Research Questions:
1. The effects of music on mental health.
2. The effects of social media use on mental health.
3. The effects of air pollution on mental health.
4. The effects of unemployment on mental health.
